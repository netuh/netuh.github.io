I am Professor of Software Engineering at the Academic Unit of Belo Jardim of the Federal Rural University of Pernambuco, where I lead the Smart City Group. I am currently the vice-coordenator of Computer Engineering Course.

I investigate and develop tools and techniques for improving software development quality and productivity levels, especially by reducing unnecessary effort and frustration in software developers work activities. I pursue a mix of academic excellence with societal relevance.

My main research interests are in the following topics and their integration: Smart Cities, Data Analitics, and Software Engineering.
